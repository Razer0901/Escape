# Escape
This is an educational game made for HACS. The game teaches basic scripting through sending units on missions to discover more information of surroundings.

### The game
* Hidden maze on an map
* You are at the start and want to direct your "boss unit" to the end
* You send out "units" by telling them what to do through short scripts
* Each unit will reveal more of the maze
* Once you are sure of your script, send out your boss unit
* Each unit you sacrifice loses you lives, (scales with the unit importance)
